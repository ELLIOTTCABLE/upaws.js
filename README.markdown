`Âµpaws.js`
=========
Some small Paws, written in JavaScript on top of [Node.js][]. Used for rapid-prototyping and general
tomfoolery of all sorts. **Do not expect stability, completeness, or sanity.** Do expect bugs,
deviations from the original design, and silliness.

> Explicitly will-not-implement: concurrency; distribution; nuketypes beyond `empty`, `label`, and
   `execution`
